                  </p>In most cases, a park and an addition to Mass-Transit wouldn’t be rolled in together outside of whimsical Solar punk fantasy.But according to Queenslink advocates, the 3.5-mile-long abandoned LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch can be both a railway and a phenomenal park. In contrast to the QueensWay project that pushed strictly for a 47-acre park (with a Metropolitan hub) Mayor Eric Adams allocated a $35 million dollar investment for last September. 
                  <p>
                    The Queenslink project currently proposes to build the borough’s first north-south subway line, four new stations (with transfers to the A, J/Z, EFR,7, and LIRR) and 33 acres of parks and protected bike lanes mixed in. The project's current focus is on getting Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul to greenlight an environmental impact statement to study the benefits of the project, according to the Tech Transit Association. 
                  </p>
                  <p> Mike Scala, a Queens resident, and legal advisor to the Queenslink team said residents see the project as more than just transportation. “It’s about infrastructure. It’s about keeping South Queens connected to the rest of the city and giving its residents chances that other residents (of the city)have.” <p>
                    Of the top ten neighborhoods with the longest commutes in NYC,<a href="https://nycfuture.org/data/fast-city-slow-commute#:~:text=In%20all%20but%20one%20of,support%20from%20the%20Bernard%20F."target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">four of them are in Queens,</a> according to the Center for an Urban Future. But how can long commutes affect residents?

      <p class="icon-text">Longer commutes result in a reduction of sleep duration by 28-35% on average and may also play an active role in sleep quality considering the association between insomnia and longer commute times.Lack of sleep has been linked to diminished awareness,impaired memory, and an increased likelihood for car accidents. </p>
